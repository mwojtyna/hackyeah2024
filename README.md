# hackyeah2024 - Better Web

## Prerequisites

You need to have `node v20.17.0` as well as `npm` installed on your system.

To install node dependencies run `npm ci` command in the root directory of this
repository.

## Quickly running the app

To quickly run the project use `PROD=1 npm start` command. It will open app in
a new window, with which you can freely interact. If you want to open DevTools
as well, run `npm start` without the `PROD` variable.

You don't need to install `ollama` on your device if you don't want to. By
default you will be using our small server which doesn't have much power.
It's good enough for a short demo.
